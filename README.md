Dont make your vm too obvious as it will shred itself, same with debuggers

And also dont use the way i sent requests here as your method of communication, its decoy traffic

Obviously dont do anything illegal w/ this (and also its stupid since fileless is objectively more effective)

Do whatever you want, you can't do much with it anyways
